  "SubRip subtitles (.srt) as data — 'hiccup for captions'. An SRT file is a numbered list of timed text
   cues, so it maps onto EDN directly — a caption track is composable data you fork and diff. The
   timed-text sibling to kotoba.otio on the video axis. `.cljc` (portable timestamp formatting).

   A cue is `[:cue {:from sec :to sec} text…]`; cues are auto-numbered 1.. and times (seconds, a number)
   are formatted as HH:MM:SS,mmm. Multiple text strings become multi-line cue text.
     [:cue {:from 1 :to 4} \"Hello world\"]
       → 1
         00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:04,000
         Hello world
     (srt cue…)  joins cues with the blank-line separator SubRip requires."
